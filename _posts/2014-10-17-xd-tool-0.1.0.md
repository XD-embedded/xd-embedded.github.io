# {{ page.title }}

Hurray! The first milestone in the XD-embedded project has been reached.  I
have released XD-tool 0.1.0, the first release in the XD-embedded project.

The goal of this release has been to produce a usable tool for the XD-build
core development.  With this release, you will be able to:

- Create a new (empty) manifest
- List known available layers
- Add layers to the manifest
- Show the manifest layer status
- Control layer ordering from layer and/or manifest configuration
- Run XD commands provided by layers

The release includes a decent set of unittests, which when run reaches 100%
coverage.  But other than that, the release has not seen much testing.

As the version indicates, XD-tool is in an early development phase.  It should
not be considered API stable.  It is expected to change during the development
of XD-build, aiming for a stable 1.0.0 release before XD-build core is
released.

But please, go ahead, grab XD-tool from GitHub:
[https://github.com/XD-embedded/xd-tool](https://github.com/XD-embedded/xd-tool)

And play around with it.  And please, let me know what you think.  I am on IRC
\#xd-embedded on Freenode, and <esben@haabendal.dk>
