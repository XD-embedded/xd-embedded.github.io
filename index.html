<a name="what-is-xd-embedded" class="anchor" href="#what-is-xd-embedded"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is XD-embedded</h1>

<p>XD-embedded is a project, with the goal of developing tools for building
and maintaining embedded Linux systems and products.</p>

<p>The overall idea is to always keep the developers needs in focus.  Tools and
the procedures needed to use these tools should be designed and implemented
with a strong focus on keeping the developers happy.  When developers are
strugling with tools, they get unhappy (and inefficient).</p>

<p>XD-embedded tools therefore must be easy to use, intuitive (obey principle of
least suprise), and efficient.</p>

<h2>
<a name="software-components" class="anchor" href="#software-components"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software components</h2>

<p>The software components that are currently being developed under the
XD-embedded umbrella is:</p>

<ul>
<li>XD-tool, the front-end tool for working with XD-embedded manifests.</li>
<li>XD-build, a build and integration system for building embedded system
firmware and SDK images.</li>
<li>XD-req, a requirement management system.</li>
</ul><p>Other possible additions, although no actual work is planned for them are:</p>

<ul>
<li>XD-test, a test system for automatic execution of on-target tests.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="focus-on-developers" class="anchor" href="#focus-on-developers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Focus on developers</h2>

<p>In this phase of the project, the focus is to serve the need of XD-embedded
developers, ie. those working on developing the XD-embedded software
components.  This includes both developers wanting to help develop the
XD-build system, and those wanting to help develop recipes for XD-build.</p>

<p>As a consequence, we must focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer documentation, both source-code and design documentation</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>Developer friendly features, fx. debug features</li>
</ul><p>Later on, focus will be extended to developers wanting to help write and
maintain XD-build recipes, and finally also those doing system and product
development with XD-build.</p>

<a name="what-does-xd-stand-for" class="anchor" href="#what-does-xd-stand-for"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does XD stand for?</h1>

<p>The name XD-embedded were chosen because:</p>

<ul>
<li>'X' for cross, 'D' for docker, main concepts for the build system</li>
<li>although usable for other purposes, the main goal use-case is embedded Linux
system development</li>
<li>you will have so much fun working with XD-embedded</li>
<li>a lot of other possible names were already spoken for</li>
</ul>
