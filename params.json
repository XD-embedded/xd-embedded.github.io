{"name":"XD-embedded","tagline":"Making embedded system development fun","body":"# What is XD-embedded\r\n\r\nXD-embedded is a project, with the goal of developing tools for building\r\nand maintaining embedded Linux systems and products.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to always keep the developers needs in focus.  Tools and\r\nthe procedures needed to use these tools should be designed and implemented\r\nwith a strong focus on keeping the developers happy.  When developers are\r\nstrugling with tools, they get unhappy (and inefficient).\r\n\r\nXD-embedded tools therefore must be easy to use, intuitive (obey principle of\r\nleast suprise), and efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Software components\r\n\r\nThe software components that are currently being developed under the\r\nXD-embedded umbrella is:\r\n\r\n* XD-tool, the front-end tool for working with XD-embedded manifests.\r\n* XD-build, a build and integration system for building embedded system\r\n  firmware and SDK images.\r\n* XD-req, a requirement management system.\r\n\r\nOther possible additions, although no actual work is planned for them are:\r\n\r\n* XD-test, a test system for automatic execution of on-target tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Focus on developers\r\n\r\nIn this phase of the project, the focus is to serve the need of XD-embedded\r\ndevelopers, ie. those working on developing the XD-embedded software\r\ncomponents.  This includes both developers wanting to help develop the\r\nXD-build system, and those wanting to help develop recipes for XD-build.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, we must focus on:\r\n\r\n* Developer documentation, both source-code and design documentation\r\n* Code quality\r\n* Developer friendly features, fx. debug features\r\n\r\nLater on, focus will be extended to developers wanting to help write and\r\nmaintain XD-build recipes, and finally also those doing system and product\r\ndevelopment with XD-build.\r\n\r\n\r\n# What does XD stand for?\r\n\r\nThe name XD-embedded were chosen because:\r\n\r\n* 'X' for cross, 'D' for docker, main concepts for the build system\r\n* although usable for other purposes, the main goal use-case is embedded Linux\r\n  system development\r\n* you will have so much fun working with XD-embedded\r\n* a lot of other possible names were already spoken for\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
